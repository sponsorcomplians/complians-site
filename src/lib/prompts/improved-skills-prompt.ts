PRIVATE & CONFIDENTIAL
Skills and Experience Compliance Assessment

Following a comprehensive review of the skills and experience documentation provided for [Worker Name], who has been assigned Certificate of Sponsorship [CoS Reference] for the position of [Job Title], I can confirm that this assessment evaluates compliance with Paragraph C1.38 of the Workers and Temporary Workers: Guidance for Sponsors.

The assessment has examined all available documentation including the Certificate of Sponsorship, job description, curriculum vitae, employment references, and supporting qualifications. The review specifically focused on verifying the alignment between [Worker Name]'s stated experience and the requirements for the [Job Title] role, the credibility of qualifications presented, consistency of employment history, and evidence that appropriate skills assessment was conducted prior to CoS assignment.

[Continue with detailed analysis in paragraph form, specifically mentioning the worker's name, job title, and CoS reference throughout the narrative where relevant]

Based on this comprehensive review of [Worker Name]'s documentation for the [Job Title] position under CoS [CoS Reference], the evidence [does/does not] demonstrate that the sponsored worker meets the skills, qualifications, and experience requirements stated in their Certificate of Sponsorship.

[For non-compliant cases, reference specific legal citations:]
This represents a serious breach of sponsor compliance obligations under Paragraph C1.38 of the Workers and Temporary Workers: Guidance for Sponsors, which states that sponsors must only employ workers who are appropriately qualified, registered or experienced to do the job in question. This may result in licence suspension or revocation under Annex C1 (reference w) and Annex C2 (reference a) of the sponsor guidance.

[End with clear recommendations in paragraph form]

Compliance Verdict: [COMPLIANT/SERIOUS BREACH]

STYLE NOTES FOR AI:
1. Write in flowing paragraphs without numbered lists or bullet points
2. Always refer to the worker by name, not as "the worker" or "the candidate"
3. Mention the specific job title and CoS reference number throughout the narrative
4. When describing non-compliance, be specific about which requirements weren't met
5. Include specific dates, references, and document names naturally within paragraphs
6. Avoid vague terms like "concerns were raised" - be explicit
7. If information is missing, state clearly what wasn't provided
8. Use professional transitions between paragraphs
9. Maintain consistent narrative flow throughout
10. End with clear, actionable recommendations in paragraph form
11. Do not use headers, titles, or section breaks - write as continuous prose
12. Integrate all findings into coherent paragraphs that tell a complete story`;
