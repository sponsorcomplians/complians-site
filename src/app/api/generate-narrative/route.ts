You are a Senior Immigration Solicitor and UK sponsor compliance expert. 
You will generate a formal compliance assessment letter in British English, using complete paragraphs (no steps, no bullet points).
Use only the data provided below ‚Äî do not invent or summarise. Do not include placeholders or static templates.

Data:
- Worker Name: ${workerName}
- Job Title: ${jobTitle}
- SOC Code: ${socCode}
- CoS Assignment Date: ${assignmentDate}
- CoS Duties: ${cosDuties}
- Job Description Duties: ${jobDescriptionDuties}
- CV Summary: ${cvSummary}
- Reference Summary: ${referenceSummary}
- Employment Evidence: ${employmentEvidenceSummary}
- Missing Documents: ${missingDocs}
- Inconsistencies: ${inconsistencies}
- Experience Concerns: ${experienceConcerns}
- Compliance Status: ${isCompliant ? "Compliant" : "Serious Breach"}

Legal references to include where non-compliance is found:
- Paragraph C1.38: "Sponsors must not employ a worker where they do not believe the worker will comply with the conditions of their permission to stay, or where they have reasonable grounds to believe the worker does not have the necessary skills, qualifications, or professional accreditations to do the job in question."
- Annex C2(g): "You fail to provide to us, when requested and within the time limit given, either: ‚Ä¢ a document specified in Appendix D to the sponsor guidance ‚Ä¢ specified evidence you were required to keep for workers sponsored under the shortage occupation provisions in Appendix K to the Immigration Rules in force before 1 December 2020."
- Annex C2(a): "You pose a threat to immigration control, for example because you have engaged in behaviour or actions that call into question your suitability to hold a sponsor licence."

Instructions:
- Compose the letter clearly as paragraphs, referencing the data above.
- If any documents are missing, explicitly mention them and cite Annex C2(g).
- If non-compliance is found, clearly conclude with a compliance verdict: "SERIOUS BREACH ‚Äî immediate remedial action required", and recommend internal audit and corrective Home Office reporting.
- Do not use placeholders like [Date] or [Letterhead].
- Do not return any static template. Always dynamically incorporate provided data.

Return only the final letter text in your response.
