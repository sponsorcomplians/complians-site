# Product Requirements Document (PRD)
## Complians Platform - Structure Improvement Initiative

### Version 1.0 - January 2025

---

## Executive Summary

Complians is a UK immigration compliance platform that helps sponsors manage their compliance obligations through AI-powered assessments. This PRD outlines structural improvements to enhance scalability, maintainability, and user experience while addressing current technical debt.

## Current State Analysis

### Strengths
- Comprehensive AI compliance coverage (15+ specialized agents)
- Multi-tenant architecture with role-based access control
- Integrated billing system with usage-based pricing
- Production-ready deployment on Vercel with Supabase

### Key Issues
1. **Code Duplication**: 80% code overlap across AI agent dashboards
2. **Incomplete Features**: Multiple "Coming Soon" placeholders affecting user trust
3. **Security Gaps**: Authentication temporarily disabled, API keys exposed
4. **Performance Issues**: Unoptimized async operations, memory leaks
5. **Testing Deficit**: 0% test coverage for core application code
6. **Maintenance Burden**: 1000+ line component files with mixed concerns

## Proposed Architecture Improvements

### 1. Component Architecture Refactoring

#### Current State
```
src/components/
├── ui/              # Mixed Radix UI and custom components
├── dashboards/      # 15+ duplicate dashboard files (1000+ lines each)
└── [features]/      # Inconsistent component organization
```

#### Proposed State
```
src/
├── components/
│   ├── ui/          # Pure UI components (buttons, cards, etc.)
│   ├── features/    # Feature-specific components
│   │   ├── compliance/
│   │   │   ├── ComplianceDashboard.tsx    # Generic dashboard
│   │   │   ├── ComplianceAgent.tsx        # Reusable agent component
│   │   │   └── hooks/                     # Shared compliance hooks
│   │   ├── workers/
│   │   ├── billing/
│   │   └── auth/
│   └── layouts/     # Layout components
├── lib/
│   ├── ai/          # Unified AI service layer
│   │   ├── AIService.ts                   # Single AI service
│   │   ├── prompts/                       # Organized prompts
│   │   └── types.ts                       # AI-related types
│   └── utils/       # Utility functions
```

### 2. AI Service Consolidation

#### Current Implementation Issues
- Duplicate AI services with similar functionality
- Inconsistent error handling
- No caching strategy
- Missing rate limiting

#### Proposed Unified AI Service
```typescript
interface AIServiceConfig {
  provider: 'openai' | 'anthropic' | 'google';
  model: string;
  temperature: number;
  maxRetries: number;
  cacheEnabled: boolean;
  rateLimitPerMinute: number;
}

class UnifiedAIService {
  // Single entry point for all AI operations
  async generateNarrative(params: NarrativeParams): Promise<NarrativeResponse>
  async analyzeDocument(params: DocumentParams): Promise<AnalysisResponse>
  async assessCompliance(params: ComplianceParams): Promise<AssessmentResponse>
}
```

### 3. Database Schema Optimization

#### Proposed Changes
1. **Normalize compliance agent configurations**
   - Create `compliance_agent_configs` table
   - Remove hardcoded agent definitions

2. **Implement proper audit trail**
   - Add `compliance_audit_trails` table
   - Track all AI assessments with versioning

3. **Optimize worker data model**
   - Add indexes for frequent queries
   - Implement soft deletes

### 4. Security Enhancements

#### Immediate Actions Required
1. **Re-enable authentication** across all routes
2. **Implement API key rotation** system
3. **Add input sanitization** for AI prompts
4. **Implement rate limiting** on AI endpoints
5. **Add request signing** for internal APIs

#### Security Architecture
```
API Gateway → Authentication → Rate Limiting → Input Validation → Business Logic
```

### 5. Performance Optimization Strategy

#### Frontend Optimizations
1. **Code splitting** by route and feature
2. **React.memo** for expensive components
3. **Virtual scrolling** for large lists
4. **Image optimization** with Next.js Image component
5. **Bundle size reduction** through tree shaking

#### Backend Optimizations
1. **Implement caching layer** for AI responses
2. **Database connection pooling**
3. **Background job processing** for reports
4. **CDN integration** for static assets

### 6. Testing Strategy

#### Proposed Testing Pyramid
