# Agent UI Migration Rollout Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the phased migration from the current agent UI (`/ai-agents`) to the redesigned version (`/agents-v2`). The migration will be executed in phases to minimize risk and ensure smooth transition.

## Current State Analysis

- **UI Components**: Various components in `/components/ui/` and `/components/`

### New Components (agents-v2)
- **Main Page**: `/app/agents-v2/page.tsx` (redesigned agent listing)
- **Components**: `/components/agents-v2/` (isolated, redesigned components)
- **Toggle System**: Environment-based UI switching
